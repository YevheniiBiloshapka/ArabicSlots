      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Local Payment Methods</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>Online gambling sites in New Zealand must support a big number of banking options that are widely accepted among locals.

      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>A Chance to Pay with New Zealand Dollars</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>Apart from a traditional currency like USD and EUR, an online casino should provide deposits and winnings in NZD. This allows for avoiding conversion fees and knowing exactly how much you spend. If you don’t find the information on the website, contact customer support to clarify this issue. Choosing online casinos with NZ dollars is always a good idea.</p>

    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Check out the game’s RTP.</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>A return-to-player rate is one of the most important indicators that shows the game’s profitability. The higher it is, the more rewarding a slot may be. You should stick to pokies that have a 95% RTP and higher.</p>
