    <p >Even though most online casinos are universal and it doesn’t matter where to play,
      choosing a brand that targets Kiwis is a wise decision. Below, we want to tell you what features top New Zealand
      online casinos should possess.</p>

  <ul class='casino-req__list' >
    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Local Payment Methods</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>Online gambling sites in New Zealand must support a big number of banking options that are widely accepted among locals. For example, Visa, Mastercard, POLi, Paysafecard, Skrill, and Neteller. The availability of Bitcoin is also a big plus because crypto casinos allow full anonymity and outstanding data encryption.</p>
    </li>
    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>A Chance to Pay with New Zealand Dollars</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>Apart from a traditional currency like USD and EUR, an online casino should provide deposits and winnings in NZD. This allows for avoiding conversion fees and knowing exactly how much you spend. If you don’t find the information on the website, contact customer support to clarify this issue. Choosing online casinos with NZ dollars is always a good idea.</p>
    </li>
    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Support For the English Language</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>Almost every NZ online casino is available in English, so most likely Kiwis won’t experience any inconveniences. But the best NZ casinos made it even one step further and have website versions translated into New Zealand English considering local language peculiarities.</p>

    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Reviews Written by Our Kiwi Visitors</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>When choosing the best New Zealand online casino, pay attention to the comments left by Kiwis. This will let you understand whether the brand is suitable for you or not. Luckily, top-rated casino sites have thousands of feedbacks and it is easy to find comments from the locals.</p>
    </li>
    <li class='casino-req__list--item'>
      <h3 class='casino-req__list--item--title'>Check out the game’s RTP.</h3>
      <p class='casino-req__list--item--desc'>A return-to-player rate is one of the most important indicators that shows the game’s profitability. The higher it is, the more rewarding a slot may be. You should stick to pokies that have a 95% RTP and higher.</p>
